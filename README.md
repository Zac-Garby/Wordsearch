# Wordsearch

![](https://github.com/Zac-Garby/Wordsearch/raw/master/img/wordsearch.png)

Wordsearch allows you to query *over 350,000* words using a regex. For example,
you could search for `(word|search).*`, which would give you 78 words: search,
searchable, searchableness, and many more.

## Usage

It's pretty simple to use. Just clone the repository and open _index.html_, then type
a regex in the regex box. Or, run the following commands (unix/macos):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zac-Garby/Wordsearch
open Wordsearch/index.html
```
